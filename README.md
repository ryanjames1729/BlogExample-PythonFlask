# BlogExample-PythonFlask

This repo's purpose is to give the students in my Web Design class an idea of how to build a simple site that uses Python Flask as the backend with a SQL database by rendering HTML templates to serve up the data. The site has a built in user name and passowrd for admin. This can be retrieved from db that is posted here. Again this is just a simple example and can be extended to make a more complex site with more features.
